<h3  style="color:white">Mizoram (English: /mɪˈzɔːrəm/ (About this sound listen)) is a state in Northeast India, with Aizawl as its capital city. The name is derived from "Mizo", the name of the native inhabitants, and "Ram", which means land, and thus Mizoram means "land of the Mizos".[4] Within the northeast region, it is the southernmost landlocked state, sharing borders with three of the Seven Sister States, namely Tripura, Assam and Manipur. The state also shares a 722 kilometre border with the neighbouring countries of Bangladesh and Myanmar.[5]

Like several other northeastern states of India, Mizoram was previously part of Assam until 1972, when it was carved out as a Union Territory. It became the 23rd state of India, a step above Union Territory, on 20 February 1987, with Fifty-Third Amendment of Indian Constitution, 1986.[6]

Mizoram's population was 1,091,014, according to a 2011 census. It is the 2nd least populous state in the country.[7] Mizoram covers an area of approximately 21,087 square kilometres.[8] About 91% of the state is forested.[9]

About 95% of the current population is of diverse tribal origins who settled in the state, mostly from Southeast Asia, over waves of migration starting about the 16th century but mainly in the 18th century.[10] This is the highest concentration of tribal people among all states of India, and they are currently protected under Indian constitution as a Scheduled Tribe.[11] Mizoram is one of three states of India with a Christian majority (87%).[12] Its people belong to various denominations, mostly Presbyterian in its north and Baptists in south.

Mizoram is a highly literate agrarian economy, but suffers from slash-and-burn jhum, or shifting cultivation, and poor crop yields.[13] In recent years, the jhum farming practices are steadily being replaced with a significant horticulture and bamboo products industry.[14][15] The state's gross state domestic product for 2012 was estimated at ₹6,991 crore (US$1.1 billion).[8] About 20% of Mizoram's population lives below poverty line, with 35% rural poverty.[16] The state has about 871 kilometres of national highways, with NH-54 and NH-150 connecting it to Assam and Manipur respectively. It is also a growing transit point for trade with Myanmar and Bangladesh.[17]

The state of Mizoram is popularly known as the songbird of India and is one of the smallest states in the country. The name Mizoram signifies the land of the Lushai highlanders. It is located in the southern corner of Northeast India nestled mainly between Myanmar and Bangladesh, but also shares a part of its boundaries with its neighboring states of Assam, Manipur and Tripura. The hilly region of Mizoram was previously a part of Assam but was later made a separate state. It is a diverse land with mountains and valleys as well tribal villages and urban centers with modern culture and lifestyle unlike elsewhere in India.

Shrouded as the mist that prevails the hills, not much is known or was recorded about the history of Mizoram. The oral traditions of most tribes of Mizoram believe to have originated from Khul, a mythical cave in southern China which was believed to be a hole in the earth. The tribes then migrated westwards to Manipur, then southwards to Assam and finally settled in the hills of Mizoram and Chin region of Myanmar. Prior to the arrival of British, the tribes had independent chiefdoms and some were tributary chiefs to the kings of Manipur. Mizoram was the last territory to be explored and conquered by the British in India in nineteenth century. The tea plantations in Cachar area of southern Assam near the foothills of Mizoram were often subjected to raids by the hill tribes. This led the British to send military expeditions to the Lushai hills in 1840 to revenge the hill tribes. Opportunists as they were, the British eventually colonized the hills with the help of the Thadou tribe in 1850 when the tribes were at war with each other. The Mizo hills finally became a part of British India in 1895; the northern area was a part of Assam while the south was a part of Bengal. Both parts were merged together to form Lusai Hills province. After independence, Mizoram was carved out as a separate state from Assam after decades of insurgency when the hill folk demanded for self rule. Peace was restored in 1986 and ever since Mizoram has become a peaceful and highly literate Christian state where the air carries folk, music and scents of flowers.

Aizawl, located near the Tropic of Cancer, is the bustling hilly capital of Mizoram. Though a small town with large churches, it is interesting to see fashionable urban culture and modern lifestyle of its residents. Lunglei in the southern part of Mizoram is another important town, it was the centre of administration during the British colonial days when the British troops conquered southern Lushai Hills and built Fort Lunglei. Small towns such as Champhai, Serchip and Saiha also developed in the recent decades due to border trade with Myanmar. Hmuifang, located near the cliffs of Hmuifangtlang is a small town which has significance for tourism and adventures.

This landlocked little state is a land of scenic beauty with a variety of landscape from the ridges of Aizawl, deep gorges of Hmuifang, valley of Champhai to the lofty peaks of Blue Mountain National Park. The hills are also blessed with beautiful water bodies such as the Vantawng Falls, Tam Dil and Rih Dil lakes that have attracted many visitors who seek to enjoy the scenery of the highlands. Though the indigenous people may have been influenced by western missionaries, they still believe in the old tribal practices of welcom

                     <h3  style="color:white"> <p>The culture of Mizoram is well known for the colorful attire of the womenfolk, their musical festivals and the popular Cheraw bamboo dance during the festivals. The people of Mizoram mainly comprises of various Tibeto-Burman groups of Kuki tribe such as Hmar, Lushai, Ralte, Pawi, Thadou and Zou. However with a sense of unity they prefer to call themselves as Mizo as most of the tribes speak Mizo Tawng, the common language. The term Kuki, referring to the frontier highlanders, was used by the neighboring Bengali people of the plains. They are also referred as Chin people by the Burmese. The Mizo tribes dwell mainly in the Lushai Hills and also in the surrounding mountains of Chin region of the Kingdom of Myanmar.

The Hmars were the first group to enter Mizoram. Their place of origin is believed to be in China and they made their way through Myanmar by learning and adopting cultures of the Burmese tribes of Shan mountains. They are also known as northerners as many Hmar villages are also located in the northern neighboring states of Assam and Manipur. Though the Hmars were savage headhunters, they are also known for their colorful costumes and ceremonial dances. Ralte tribe is one of the largest Mizo groups, they live in Champhai area and resisted invasions of other tribes, having stone carvings which depict their history. Zou tribe dwell mainly in the areas bordering Chin hills of Myanmar, have their own language and the Zoulai script. Zous also protested activities of British missionaries as they preserved their old Sakhua religion. The Lushais are the largest Mizo community. The Lushais were headhunters and also practiced slavery of captured enemies, similar to most tribal cultures of Southeast Asia. Their conflict with the British eventually led to the discovery and colonization of Mizoram. Some Lushai people also consider themselves to be Jews of Bnei Menashe, one of the lost tribes of Israel. The Lai and Mara are two other major tribes of Mizoram who are culturally different from other Kuki groups, inhabitanting parts of southern Mizoram and having their own languages and script. The Reang people (Bru tribe) of Mamit area near Tripura are considered as one of the oldest inhabitants of these hills, they are however a smaller community now in Mizoram. They were believed to have been exiled by Tripuri kings. The Chakma tribe of the Chittagong hills of Bangladesh also have settlements in the foothills of Mizoram bordering Bangladesh and follow Theraveda Buddhism.:</strong></p>

Various tribes migrated from different places, arrived in waves and made these hills their homeland. However, few aspects of tribal culture continue to remain common among all the groups of Mizo society. All the tribes practiced Jhum cultivation as many migrated in search of better pastures. Hnatlang, or community service was an important activity for community welfare. All villages had Zwalbuk dormitory, the central point of the village where Mizo youths were trained to carry out social responsibilities. Above all, most Mizo tribes believed in the ethics of Tlawmingaihna moral code which made them courteous and helpful to others. Most of the Kuki-Mizo-Chin tribes were then converted into Christianity by the missionaries during the colonial period. They benefited from the western education and soon became a progressive community.

The people of Mizoram are experts in cane and bamboo work as they prepare numerous items of bamboo, right from the cane walls of their houses to furnitures and cane hats. Due to the presence of abundant bamboo forests in the state, the hill folk utilize this gift of nature for their daily domestic use and has now become a part of Mizo culture. Basketry is a popular craft, baskets such as Paikawng, Thulte and Tlamen of various shapes and sizes are crafted for different purposes. Bamboo furnitures such as Herhsawp stool, Thuttleng chair and Tuium water containers can be seen in most households. The Mizos also smoke the cane to make it durable and long lasting. The ceremonial Khumbeu hats are made out of the waterproof Hnahthial leaves. Mizo women excel in weaving. Puanchei and Kawrchei textiles are the beautiful costumes of Mizoram worn during the Kut festivals and Cheraw bamboo dance

                     <h3  style="color:white"> <p> Delhi's culture has been influenced by its lengthy history and historic association as the capital of India, Although a strong Punjabi Influence can be seen in language, Dress and Cuisine brought by the large number of refugees who came following the partition in 1947 the recent migration from other parts of India has made it a melting pot. This is exemplified by many significant monuments in the city. Delhi is also identified as the location of Indraprastha, the ancient capital of the Pandavas. The Archaeological Survey of India recognises 1200 heritage buildings[165] and 175 monuments as national heritage sites.[166] In the Old City, the Mughals and the Turkic rulers constructed several architecturally significant buildings, such as the Jama Masjid – India's largest mosque[167] built in 1656[168] and the Red Fort. Three World Heritage Sites – the Red Fort, Qutab Minar and Humayun's Tomb – are located in Delhi.[169] Other monuments include the India Gate, Lotus Temple, is a Bahá'í House of Worship completed in 1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, it serves as the Mother Temple of the Indian subcontinent and has become a prominent attraction in the city. The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and been featured in hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles. Like all other Bahá'í Houses of Worship, is open to all regardless of religion, or any other distinction, as emphasised in Bahá'í texts. The Bahá'í laws emphasise that the spirit of the House of Worship be that it is a gathering place where people of all religions may worship God without denominational restrictions.[171] The Bahá'í laws also stipulate that only the holy scriptures of the Bahá'í Faith and other religions can be read or chanted inside in any language; while readings and prayers can be set to music by choirs, no musical instruments can be played inside. Furthermore, no sermons can be delivered, and there can be no ritualistic ceremonies practised.[171]
Chandni Chowk, a 17th-century market, is one of the most popular shopping areas in Delhi for jewellery and Zari saris.[172] Delhi's arts and crafts include, Zardozi[173]  – an embroidery done with gold thread – [174] and Meenakari[175] – the art of enamelling.

Daulat Chaat is made using a complicated technique of condensing milk foam on a cold night, this dish is only available during winters.[185]
As India's national capital and centuries old Mughal capital, Delhi influenced the food habits of its residents and is where Mughlai cuisineoriginated. Along with Indian cuisine, a variety of international cuisines are popular among the residents.[186] The dearth of food habits among the city's residents created a unique style of cooking which became popular throughout the world, with dishes such as Kebab, biryani, tandoori. The city's classic dishes include butter chicken, dal makhani, shahi paneer, aloo chaat, chaat, dahi bhalla, kachori, gol gappe, samosa, chole bhature, chole kulche, gulab jamun, jalebi and lassi.[186][187]:40–50, 189–196
The fast living habits of Delhi's people has motivated the growth of street food outlets.[187]:41 A trend of dining at local dhabas is popular among the residents. High-profile restaurants have gained popularity in recent years, among the popular restaurants are the Karim Hotel, the Punjab Grill and Bukhara.[188] The Gali Paranthe Wali (the street of fried bread) is a street in Chandni Chowk particularly for food eateries since the 1870s. Almost the entire street is occupied by fast food stalls or street vendors. It has nearly become a tradition that almost every prime minister of India has visited the street to eat paratha at least once. Other Indian cuisines are also available in this area even though the street specialises in north Indian food .[187]:40–50[189]
