<p style="color:black">Bihar (/bɪˈhɑːr/; Hindustani pronunciation: [bɪˈɦaːr]) is an Indian state considered to be a part of Eastern[10][11] as well as Northern India.[12][13][14] It is the 13th-largest state of India, with an area of 94,163 km2 (36,357 sq mi). The third-largest state of India by population, it is contiguous with Uttar Pradesh to its west, Nepal to the north, the northern part of West Bengal to the east, with Jharkhand to the south. The Bihar plain is split by the river Ganges which flows from west to east.[10] Bihar is an amalgamation of three main distinct regions, these are Magadh, Mithila and Bhojpur.[15]
On 15 November 2000, southern Bihar was ceded to form the new state of Jharkhand.[16] Only 11.3% of the population of Bihar lives in urban areas, which is the lowest in India after Himachal Pradesh.[17] Additionally, almost 58% of Biharis are below the age of 25,[18] giving Bihar the highest proportion of young people of any Indian state. The official languages of the state are Hindi and Urdu.[8][9] Other languages commonly used within the state include Bhojpuri, Maithili, Magahi, Bajjika, and Angika (Maithili is the only one of these to be officially accepted by the government).[19][20]
In ancient and classical India, the area that is now Bihar was considered a centre of power, learning, and culture.[21] From Magadha arose India's first empire, the Maurya empire, as well as one of the world's most widely adhered-to religions, Buddhism.[22] Magadha empires, notably under the Maurya and Gupta dynasties, unified large parts of South Asia under a central rule.[23] Another region of Bihar is Mithila which was an early centre of Brahmanical learning and the centre of the Videha kingdom.[24] There is an ongoing movement in the Maithili speaking region of Bihar for a separate Indian state of Mithila. What would be the capital of the state has yet to be decided, but Darbhanga is the most likely candidate. Other potential capitals include Muzaffarpur, Purnia, Madhubani and Begusarai.[25]
Since the late 1970s, Bihar has lagged far behind other Indian states in terms of social and economic development.[26][27][28] Many economists and social scientists claim that this is a direct result of the policies of the central government, such as the Freight equalisation policy,[29][30] its apathy towards Bihar,[18][31][32] lack of Bihari sub-nationalism,[30][33][34] and the Permanent Settlement of 1793 by the British East India Company.[30] The state government has, however, made significant strides in developing the state.[35] Improved governance has led to an economic revival in the state through increased investment in infrastructure,[36] better health care facilities, greater emphasis on education, and a reduction in crime and corruption.[37][38]

Chirand, on the northern bank of the Ganga River, in Saran district, has an archaeological record from the Neolithic age (about 2500–1345 BC).[41][42]Regions of Bihar—such as Magadha, Mithila and Anga—are mentioned in religious texts and epics of ancient India.
Mithila first gained prominence after being settled by Indo-Aryan peoples who established the Videha Kingdom.[43][44] During the late Vedic period (c. 1100-500 BCE), Videha became one of the major political and cultural centers of South Asia, along with Kuru and Pañcāla. The kings of the Videha Kingdom were called Janakas.[45] Sita, a daughter of one of the Janaks of Mithila is mentioned as the consort of Lord Rama, in the Hindu epic, Ramayana, written by Valmiki.[46][43]The Videha Kingdom later became incorporated into the Vajji confederacy which had its capital in the city of Vaishali, which is also in Mithila.[47] Vajji had a republican form of government where the king was elected from the number of rajas. Based on the information found in texts pertaining to Jainism and Buddhism, Vajji was established as a republic by the 6th century BCE, before the birth of Gautama Buddha in 563 BCE, making it the world's first republic.
The region of modern-day southwestern Bihar called Magadha remained the centre of power, learning, and culture in India for 1000 years. The Haryanka dynasty, founded in 684 BC, ruled Magadha from the city of Rajgriha (modern Rajgir). The two well-known kings from this dynasty were Bimbisara and his son Ajatashatru, who imprisoned his father to ascend the throne. Ajatashatru founded the city of Pataliputra which later became the capital of Magadha. He declared war and conquered the Vajji. The Haryanka dynasty was followed by the Shishunaga dynasty. Later the Nanda Dynasty ruled a vast tract stretching from Bengal to Punjab.
The Nanda dynasty was replaced by the Maurya Empire, India's first empire. The Maurya Empire and the religion of Buddhism arose in the region that now makes up modern Bihar. The Mauryan Empire, which originated from Magadha in 325 BC, was founded by Chandragupta Maurya, who was born in Magadha. It had its capital at Pataliputra (modern Patna). The Mauryan emperor, Ashoka, who was born in Pataliputra (Patna) is believed to be one of the greatest rulers in the history of the world.[48][49]
The Gupta Empire, which originated in Magadha in 240 AD, is referred as the Golden Age of India in science, mathematics, astronomy, commerce, religion, and Indian philosophy.[50] Bihar and Bengal was invaded by Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty in the 11th century.[51][52]

Historically, Bihar has been a major centre of learning, home to the ancient universities of Nalanda (established in 450 CE), Odantapurā (established in 550CE) and Vikramashila (established in 783 CE).[135] This tradition of learning may have been stultified during the period of Turkic invasions, c. 1000 CE, at which point it is believed major education centres, maintained by reclusive communities of Buddhist monks removed from the local populace, were suppressed by the Turkic raids originating from central Asia .[136]
Bihar saw a revival of its education system during the later part of the British rule, when Patna University, the seventh oldest university of the Indian subcontinent, was established in 1917.[137] Some other centres of high learning established under British rule are Patna College (established 1839), Bihar School of Engineering (1900; now known as National Institute of Technology, Patna), Prince of Wales Medical College (1925; now Patna Medical College and Hospital), and Science College, Patna (1928), among others.
A recent survey by Pratham rated the receptivity of Bihari children to their teaching as being better than those in other states.[138]
Bihar is striving to increase female literacy, now at 53.3%, as the government establishes educational institutions. At the time of independence, women's
