<p style="color:black">Himachal Pradesh ([ɦɪmaːtʃəl prəd̪eːʃ] (  listen); literally "Abode of Snow") is a state of India located in North India. It is bordered by Jammu and Kashmir on the north, Punjab and Chandigarh on the west, Haryana on the southwest, Uttarakhand on the southeast, and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the east. At its southernmost point, it also touches the state of Uttar Pradesh. The name was coined from the Sanskrit—Him means 'snow' and achal means 'land' or 'abode'—by Acharya Diwakar Datt Sharma, one of the state's eminent Sanskrit scholars.[7]
Himachal Pradesh is known for its natural environment, hill stations, and temples.[8] Himachal Pradesh had one of the highest per-capita incomes among Indian states and union territories for the year 2014-15.[9] Many perennial rivers flow in the state. Numerous plants produce surplus hydroelectricity that is sold to other states, such as Delhi, Punjab, and Rajasthan.[10] Tourism and agriculture are additional important parts of the state's economy.[10]
The state has several valleys.[11] About 90% of the population lives in rural areas.[12] Practically all houses have a toilet and 100% hygiene has been achieved in the state.[13] The villages have good connectivity with roads, public health centres, and high-speed broadband.
Shimla district has the largest urban population in the state at 25%. Notable government actions include a ban on polyethylene bags[14] and tobacco products. A 2017 survey by an international organization ranked Himachal Pradesh India's least corrupt staTriund in September
Himachal is in the western Himalayas. Covering an area of 55,673 square kilometres (21,495 sq mi),[4] it is a mountainous state. Most of the state lies on the foothills of the Dhauladhar Range. At 7,025 m Shilla is the highest mountain peak in the state of Himachal Pradesh.[18]

The drainage system of Himachal is composed both of rivers and glaciers. Himalayan rivers criss-cross the entire mountain chain. Himachal Pradesh provides water to both the Indus and Ganges basins.[19] The drainage systems of the region are the Chandra Bhaga or the Chenab, the Ravi, the Beas, the Sutlej, and the Yamuna. These rivers are perennial and are fed by snow and rainfall. They are protected by an extensive cover of natural vegetation.[19]
Due to extreme variation in elevation, great variation occurs in the climatic conditions of Himachal . The climate varies from hot and subhumid tropical in the southern tracts to, with more elevation, cold, alpine, and glacial in the northern and eastern mountain ranges.[20] The state's winter capital, Dharamsala receives very heavy rainfall, while areas like Lahaul and Spiti are cold and almost rainless. Broadly, Himachal experiences three seasons: summer, winter, and rainy season. Summer lasts from mid-April till the end of June and most parts become very hot (except in the alpine zone which experiences a mild summer) with the average temperature ranging from 28 to 32 °C (82 to 90 °F). Winter lasts from late November till mid March. Snowfall is common in alpine tracts (generally above 2,200 metres (7,218 ft) i.e. in the higher and trans-Himalayan region). Media in Himachal
demand for handicrafts has increased within and outside the country.

Tourism in Himachal Pradesh is a major contributor to the state's economy and growth. The mountainous state with its Himalayan landscapes attracts tourists from all over the world. Hill stations like Shimla, Manali, Dalhousie, Chamba, Dharamshala and Kullu are popular destinations for both domestic and foreign tourists.[47] The state has many important pilgrimage centres with prominent Hindu temples like Naina Devi Temple, Vajreshwari Devi Temple, Jwala Ji Temple, Chintpurni, Chamunda Devi Temple, Baijnath Temple, Bhimakali Temple, Bijli Mahadev, Manu Temple at Shenshar in Kullu district, Renuka Lake and Jakhoo Temple.[48] The state is also referred to as "Dev Bhoomi" (literally meaning Abode of Gods) due to its mention in ancient holy texts and occurrence of large number of historical temples in the state.[49]
 
Triund is a campsite for travellers and trekkers on the way to Indrahar Pass, Dhauladhar Mountain Range.
It is also called the Land of the Gods on account of the Hindu belief that deities like Lord Shiva considered the Himalayas their home, and much of the state is located among the Himalayan mountains. Although modern pop-literature writers online have often also referred to Uttarakhand as the land of the gods because it also contains Himalayan mountains, officially it is Himachal Pradesh that has been considered the land of the gods since before the state of Uttarakhand existed (UK as it is abbreviated on license plates for automobiles in the state, and the state was founded in the year 2000.).[50] A tourism department board on the road when entering HLanguages[edit]
While Hindi is the official language of Himachal Pradesh and is spoken by the majority of the population as a lingua franca, the Pahari language is used in everyday conversation. English is given the status of an additional official language.[6]
