<h3  style="color:black">Kerala (/ˈkɛrələ/), historically known as Keralam, is an Indian state in South India on the Malabar Coast. It was formed on 1 November 1956 following the States Reorganisation Act by combining Malayalam-speaking regions. Spread over 38,863 km2(15,005 sq mi), it is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Seato the west. With 33,387,677 inhabitants as per the 2011 Census, Kerala is the thirteenth-largest Indian state by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the capital and the largest city being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.
The region has been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE. The Chera Dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala, though it frequently struggled against attacks by the neighbouring Cholas and Pandyas. In the 15th century, the spice tradeattracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for the European colonisation of India. At the time of Indian independence, there were two major princely states in Kerala - Travancore and Kochi. They united to form Thirukochi. The Malabar region, in the north part of present-day Kerala was under the Madras province of British India. In 1956, Kerala state was formed by merging Malabar district, Travancore-Cochin (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district), and the taluk of Kasaragod(now Kasaragod District), South Kanara (Tulunad).
Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in India, 3.44%; the highest Human Development Index (HDI), 0.712 in 2015; the highest literacy rate, 93.91% in the 2011 census; the highest life expectancy, 77 years; and the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1,000 men. The state has witnessed significant emigration, especially to Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community. Hinduism is practised by more than half of the population, followed by Islam and Christianity. The culture is a synthesis of Aryan and Dravidian cultures,[6] developed over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad.

Many of the temples in Kerala hold festivals on specific days of the year.[366] A common characteristic of these festivals is the hoisting of a holy flag which is brought down on the final day of the festival after immersing the deity.[367] Some festivals include Poorams, the best known of these being the Thrissur Pooram.[368] "Elephants, firework displays and huge crowds" are the major attractions of Thrissur Pooram.[369]Other known festivals are Makaravilakku,[370] Chinakkathoor Pooram Nenmara Vallangi Vela[371] and Utsavam.[citation needed] Temples that can afford it will usually involve at least one richly caparisoned elephant as part of the festivities. The idol in the temple is taken out on a procession around the countryside atop this elephant. When the procession visits homes around the temple, people will usually present rice, coconuts, and other offerings to it.[372] Processions often include traditional music such as Panchari melam or Panchavadyam.[373]

                     <h3  style="color:black"> <p>Kerala is home to a number of performance arts. These include five classical dance forms: Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, Koodiyattom, Thullaland Krishnanattam, which originated and developed in the temple theatres during the classical period under the patronage of royal houses.[385] Kerala natanam, Thirayattam, Kaliyattam, Theyyam, Koothu and Padayani are other dance forms associated with the temple culture of the region.[386] Some traditional dance forms such as Margamkali and Parichamuttukali are popular among the Syrian Christians and Chavittu nadakom is popular among the Latin Christians,[387][388] while Oppana and Duffmuttu are popular among the Muslims of the state.[389]The development of classical music in Kerala is attributed to the contributions it received from the traditional performance arts associated with the temple culture of Kerala.[390] The development of the indigenous classical music form, Sopana Sangeetham, illustrates the rich contribution that temple culture has made to the arts of Kerala.[390] Carnatic music dominates Keralite traditional music. This was the result of Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma's popularisation of the genre in the 19th century.[362] Raga-based renditions known as sopanam accompany kathakali performances.[391] Melam; including the paandi and panchari variants, is a more percussive style of music:[392] it is performed at Kshetram-centered festivals using the chenda. Panchavadyam is a form of percussion ensemble, in which artists use five types of percussion instrument.[392] Kerala's visual arts range from traditional murals to the works of Raja Ravi Varma, the state's most renowned painter.[390] Most of the castes and communities in Kerala have rich collections of folk songs and ballads associated with a variety of themes; Vadakkan Pattukal (Northern Ballads), Thekkan pattukal (Southern Ballads), Vanchi pattukal (Boat Songs), Mappila Pattukal (Muslim songs) and Pallipattukal (Church songs) are a few of them
